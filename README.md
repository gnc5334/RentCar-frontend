Hi! My first angular project . The project was created with architecture. C # is used as the back-end language and MSSQL is used for database. Angular, a javascript framework, is used in the front-end part. The project lasted four months, including the training. Prepared and presented by Gonca Gül Kazancı. Instructor Engin Demiroğ
